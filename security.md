# Authentication and Authorization in Tripster

Authentication and authorization are crucial aspects of Tripster to ensure the security and privacy of user data and actions within the application. In this section, we will discuss how Tripster implements authentication and authorization.

## Authentication

### User Registration and Login

Tripster allows users to create accounts and log in using various authentication methods, including email/password, Google, and Facebook. Here's how it works:

1. **User Registration**: New users can create an account by providing their email and password or by using a social media account (Google or Facebook). When registering with an email and password, Tripster securely stores the user's credentials.

2. **Email Verification**: After registering with an email and password, Tripster may send a verification email to the user. The user must verify their email address to activate their account.

3. **Logging In**: Registered users can log in by providing their credentials. Tripster verifies the user's identity, and upon successful authentication, the user gains access to their account and app features.

<!-- 4. **Social Media Authentication**: Users can choose to log in with their Google or Facebook accounts. Tripster securely handles the authentication process through these third-party services. -->

### Password Reset

If a user forgets their password, Tripster provides a "Forgot Password" functionality. Here's how it works:

1. **Password Reset Request**: Users can request a password reset by providing their registered email address. Tripster sends a password reset link to that email.

2. **Resetting the Password**: By clicking the password reset link, users can reset their password. Tripster securely updates the user's password in the database.

## Authorization

### User Roles and Permissions

Tripster uses role-based authorization to control what users can do within the application. There are typically two primary user roles:

1. **User**: Regular users who can create and manage their trips, and access the app's core features.

2. **Admin**: Admin users have additional privileges, such as managing user accounts, moderating content, and overseeing the application's operation.

### Access Control

Access to specific features and data within Tripster is controlled based on the user's role and ownership of resources. Here's how access control works:

1. **Ownership**: Users have control over the trips they purchase. 

2. **Trip Sharing**: Users can invite other users to join their trips, as participants.

3. **Admin Privileges**: Admin users have the authority to manage user accounts and take administrative actions within the application.

### Data Privacy

User data privacy is a top priority in Tripster. Sensitive user data is stored securely, and Tripster complies with data protection regulations, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), to safeguard user information.

## Security Best Practices

Tripster follows security best practices to protect user accounts and data. These practices include:

- Using HTTPS for secure data transmission.
- Implementing proper password hashing for user authentication.
- Regularly updating libraries and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Conducting security audits and testing to identify and mitigate potential security threats.

## Conclusion

Authentication and authorization are fundamental aspects of Tripster, ensuring that users can securely access and interact with the application while maintaining their data privacy. By implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, Tripster provides a safe and enjoyable user experience.
